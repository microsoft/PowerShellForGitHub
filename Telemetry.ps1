        If PII protection is enabled, returns back an SHA512-hashed value for the specified string,

    .SYNOPSIS
        If PII protection is enabled, returns back an SHA512-hashed value for the specified string,
        otherwise returns back the original string, untouched.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/PowerShellForGitHub

    .PARAMETER PlainText
        The plain text that contains PII that may need to be protected.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-PiiSafeString -PlainText "Hello World"

        Returns back the string "B10A8DB164E0754105B7A99BE72E3FE5" which respresents
        the SHA512 hash of "Hello World", but only if the "DisablePiiProtection" configuration
        value is $false.  If it's $true, "Hello World" will be returned.

    .OUTPUTS
        System.String - A SHA512 hash of PlainText will be returned if the "DisablePiiProtection"
                        configuration value is $false, otherwise PlainText will be returned untouched.

        that an exception occurred in this this module.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/PowerShellForGitHub

    .PARAMETER Exception
        The exception that just occurred.

    .PARAMETER ErrorBucket
        A property to be added to the Exception being logged to make it easier to filter to
        exceptions resulting from similar scenarios.

    .PARAMETER Properties
        Additional properties that the caller may wish to be associated with this exception.

    .PARAMETER NoFlush
        It's not recommended to use this unless the exception is coming from Flush-TelemetryClient.
        By default, every time a new exception is logged, the telemetry client will be flushed
        to ensure that the event is published to the Application Insights.  Use of this switch
        prevents that automatic flushing (helpful in the scenario where the exception occurred
        when trying to do the actual Flush).

    .PARAMETER NoStatus
        If this switch is specified, long-running commands will run on the main thread
        with no commandline status update.  When not specified, those commands run in
        the background, enabling the command prompt to provide status information.

    .EXAMPLE
        Set-TelemetryException $_

        Used within the context of a catch statement, this will post the exception that just
        occurred, along with a default set of properties.  If the telemetry client needs to be
        created to accomplish this, and the required assemblies are not available on the local
        machine, the download status will be presented at the command prompt.

    .EXAMPLE
        Set-TelemetryException $_ -NoStatus

        Used within the context of a catch statement, this will post the exception that just
